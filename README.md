# Machine Learning project
A project for Introduction to Machine Learning course, completed during 4th semester of Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

In this project, I worked with an artificially generated dataset, consisting of 2000 samples, 400 input
variables and two output variables called class and output. All input variables were standard-scaled
real numbers. My task was to build ML models predicting the output variables based on the input
variables and analyze the dataset, created models and the nature of the found dependencies.
